- **Maintainers** steward the methodology and ensure evidence-based scoring.
- **Contributors** propose changes via issues/PRs with verifiable sources.
- **Adjudication**: When coders disagree, maintainers will solicit at least two independent reviews; decisions and rationales are logged in the PR.

## Versioning

- Semantic versioning for code (vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Data releases are tagged as `data-YYYYMMDD`
