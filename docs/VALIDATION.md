# Validation Plan

We report:
- **Inter-rater reliability** for a sample of indicators with duplicate codings (Cohen's κ).
- **Sensitivity** of AIPI to different treatments of Unknown (evidence vs known-only).
- **Ablation**: per-pillar removal effect on provider ranking (Spearman ρ).

See `scripts/sensitivity.py` for a runnable analysis stub.
